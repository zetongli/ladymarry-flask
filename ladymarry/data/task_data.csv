Overall,Choose wedding party,1/1/2015,"Now it's time to start choosing your wedding party (groan...). In theory, this should be an exciting task -- a chance to round up your very favorite people to surround you on the happiest day of your life. But the reality is, you can't choose everyone, and between your siblings, your cousins, your childhood friends, your high school besties and your college roommates, you're going to need to make some cuts. So how do you narrow it down to the right handful of people -- the ones that will make things easy and fun, not the ones who will stress you out and wear you down?","DO wait to ask until you've set your wedding date. If you get engaged today but wait 18 months to get married, your inner circle might change. I'm not saying you won't still be tight with, say, your college roommate, but adding bridesmaids is a lot more fun then demoting them, so I'd hold out on asking 'til you're sure of who you'll want in the V.I.P. spots when your wedding day rolls around.

DON'T feel like you have to include all the siblings. (Or give them the ""biggest"" roles.) Having the same parents and once sharing a bedroom makes your sister, well, your sister. It doesn't automatically make her your maid of honor. By all means, ask your sister to be your MoH if you're close. But don't feel like you have to ask her if all you have in common is DNA. And definitely don't feel like you have to ask your groom's sister to be a bridesmaid. Which brings me to ...

DO have ""bridesmen"" and ""groomsgirls""! If you're close with your brother, that's great. But asking him to stand up as a groomsmen feels weird—unless he he happens to be close with your guy, too. If you'd like to give your bro an important role, I think ""bridesman"" or ""man of honor"" is more appropriate.

DON'T feel like you have to have the same number of bridesmaids and groomsmen. I just don't get some brides' obsession with having even numbers. You can shuffle the way people walk up the aisle (two bridesmaids to a groomsman or vice versa), or stand during the ceremony. And you can skip the ""wedding party join in!"" portion of your first dance—which I always found a little awkward as a bridesmaid, anyway!

DO redefine the roles. A ""maid of honor"" and ""matron of honor"" is great—unless you have two best friends and neither (or both) is married. If you want to have two ""maids"" or two ""matrons"" or no one ""of honor,"" just four equally ranked bridesmaids, do what works for you.


DON'T ask a friend just because you were in her wedding. Your friend didn't ask you to be in her wedding because she hopes to be in yours—whenever that might happen. You might want to include more family members or just keep your wedding party small. Whatever the reason, don't assume your friend (especially one you've grown apart from) expects to be in your wedding. Or wants to, for that matter.",http://www.glamour.com/weddings/blogs/save-the-date/2012/02/6-dos-and-donts-that-will-hope,"15,19,20,41,42",http://www.fotavo.com/photos/phototmv57MZOa9p3RrEzDlJu6Wsodgf4PBj1HKcQky0x

Overall,Decide on wedding colors/theme,2/1/2015,Romantic wedding? Think pastels and neutrals. A high-energy party? Go bold. Save your favorite colors to your planner so that we can start showing you more photos that match your palette.,"1.Use your favorite shade. You’ve been in love with pale lavender since the first grade, so this is a good place to begin – with what you love. You can tastefully incorporate any color into your wedding decorations by selecting the right hue, and combining it with the right accents.
2.Consider the setting. Look at the colors used in your venue’s carpeting, drapery and decorations. If the site has strong colors, you’ll need to select a color scheme that complements. If you already have your heart set on a certain color, you may need to select a more neutrally decorated site but this needs to be sorted out very early on or you may miss out on a good location! However, keep an open mind about colors until you've chosen the venue, because the setting may well suggest the color scheme for you.
3.Be prepared to have two different/distinct color themes if your church or wedding building and reception venue are very different in tone. In general, it is probable that you will have more leeway to use colors with the reception than where the wedding ceremony itself is held. However, you can still carry the color theme in clothing and flowers from the place of marriage to the reception, even if you can't decorate the church, town hall, or register office as much as you'd like.
4.Enlist your favorite bloom. If sunflowers are your thing, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t make it into your décor scheme. Incorporate your predominant flower color – either making it the dominant shade or using it as an accent – and it will all come together.
